# RequiredStaticMembers

(TODO: add the cool tags here)

## What is the library good for?

Compile-time assurance that all types that derive from an interface implement a given static member.

## How do i use it?

1. Install the package from Nuget (TODO: add link)
2. Give a static interface member the attribute `Svee4.RequiredStaticMembers.AbstractAttribute`
3. All done! A deriving type that does not implement the given member will cause an error

## I have an issue or I want to participate in development

Feel free to open an issue or discussion
